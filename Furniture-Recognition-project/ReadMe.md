After training the custom classifier using Watson Visual Recognition to identify furniture, 
in particular Tables, Beds and Chairs. After training the model we are then going to connect 
my trained custom classifier to a Flask app. Flask is a python web framework used for making web apps. 
I am then going to deploy my Flask app to IBM Cloud. Once the app is deployed on IBM Cloud anyone can 
access the Flask app via a webpage anywhere using a custom link.
